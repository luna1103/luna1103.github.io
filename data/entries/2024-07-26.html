    Alright, finally! I've had the idea for this site for quite some time now,
    but it's only now that I bothered to lay the building blocks down and
    actually make it into a site. This will be my first of hopefully many entries
    to this digital, anonymous diary.
</p>
<p>
    I'll be going into... <i>her</i>. She's basically the whole reason I decided
    to do this. As I mentioned on the homepage, I will not be mentioning people
    by their real name, so I'm going to call her Abby. Abby and I met over Discord
    in early 2021. I was 12, and she was 16. I met her through another friend of mine
    that I don't have a fake name for yet and whom isn't relevant enough to this particular
    story for me to spend the time thinking of one just yet.
</p>
<p>
    Anyways, in 2021, me and Abby were never really that close as friends. We mainly were
    together because of the aforementioned other friend, and because of a project we were
    <s>not at all</s> working on at the time.
</p>
<p>
    In the summer of 2021, Abby's girlfriend broke up with her, and that started a downward
    spiral for her. She became an alcoholic and would frequently make sexual jokes around me
    despite me expressing discomfort with them. She was also just generally... insane, I guess?
    I don't really know how else to put it. Anyhow, in November, it got to the point where she
    had personal information on me and was threatening to dox me. I ended up getting help from
    my other friend to fake my suicide and move to a new Discord account to get rid of her.
    Thankfully, that was probably the worst of all my experiences with her, when it comes to
    how "crazy" they are. It was definitely not the worst when it comes to how much of a mental
    toll it took on me, but I'll get to that later.
</p>
<p>
    In February of 2022, Abby came back to Discord under a different name. I didn't know for sure
    if it was her at first, but me and my friend had our suspicions. Eventually, she sent me a snippet
    of one of her Reddit vent posts, and my curious nosy ass decided to use an online tool to try and
    find the post. I found the post, looked through the account, and sure enough, it was Abby. I read
    through them all. She talked about her past experiences with awful people, but most of all, she
    talked about how sorry she was. How sorry she was for sexually harassing me, harassing me in 
    general, and eventually, killing me. Remember, I faked my suicide; she thought I was dead.
</p>
<p>
    I was talking to her on my new main account, same display name, profile picture from the same
    fandom, and I wasn't even trying to hide it was me. She literally had seen a GitHub commit from
    me with my old email. And despite all this, she didn't believe it was me. Those events last year
    had fucked her up so bad that she wouldn't believe I was alive even when the evidence was right
    in front of her.
</p>
<p>
    In her posts, she talked about how she wished it was me. How she wished she could say she was sorry.
    It honestly got to me. After reading those posts, basically all of the hate in my heart for her
    vanished. Maybe I'm too nice. Maybe I'm too forgiving. But anyways, I eventually confessed that, yes,
    I was alive, that I knew it was her, and that her posts had touched me and I was willing to start anew.
</p>
<p>
    It mostly went smooth. There were a few bumps in the road, but nothing major that I feel is worth
    recalling here. That was, until June 2023. In our private friend group server, I had said something
    about having secrets that you keep because you know they're weird and that people will stop liking
    you for them. Abby was intrigued by this, and asked me about it. It took me a while, but I finally
    confessed that I kind of wanted to be an Asian girl because of how pretty they are. God, it feels
    so fucking corny to type this out, but I must.
</p>
<p>
    It eventually turned into a conversation about my self image and how I didn't really take care of
    myself that well. From then, she began reminding me to brush my teeth and my hair, and, God it was
    really fucking nice. I liked it a little too much, and eventually developed a crush on her for it.
    But there were big problems. For one, she was 15, I was 19, kind of a large age gap! For two, she
    was already dating another girl, and for three, she was polyamorous, I was monogamous, the chances
    of me and her dating were practically zero! And this drove me <i>insane</i>. I was yearning so hard
    that I ended up making a whole other Twitter account just to yearnpost on. average lesbian lol
</p>
<p>
    Every day I was with her, my crush on her only grew. I fell in love with almost everything she did,
    and any time she mentioned the girl she was dating, it made me feel awful, and I would often post
    on that account. I would squeeze every drop of affection I could out of her, even getting her to
    call me a "good girl" for some time. By November, it was no secret to her that I had a huge crush
    on her. On the night of November 3rd, we would begin exchanging affection with each other. This was
    normal, but it went further this time. She would DM me talking about how she needed to do my makeup
    and then make out with me. Of course, I reciprocated, and it eventually developed into describing
    our sexual fantasies with each other while masturbating. After that, we kept chatting, her eventually
    saying she considered me her wife, and that she was going to eventually break up with her other 
    girlfriend to be with me exclusively. Looking back... yeah, it was just really impulsive on her part,
    and also on my part. I was so entranced with the fact that I was finally dating the girl of my dreams
    that I barely questioned the validity of it all.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to May of this year, and, OH MY GOD, EVERYTHING. FUCKING. SUCKS. Now, she's breaking up
    with me because of our age gap, and how uncomfortable she is with it. It was my birthday. She broke up
    with me on my birthday. What a fucking sweet 16. At first, I thought it was just because of the age gap,
    and that I maybe had a chance with her again if I just waited until I was 18. That was not the case. She
    eventually confessed to me that it was because she was more content with her other girlfriend and being
    polyamorous, and that she was basically only doing it to make me happy.
</p>
<p>
    So basically, she had lead me on for 6 months just to say "fuck you" and dump me. Yeah, it fucking hurt.
    And what's even worse is that some insane bitch made her fucking lose it and make our now former
    relationship public knowledge. She started acting really weird and mean and eventually had to just 
    a break from it all. Even after all of this, I still can't help but imagine that perfect girl... the one
    who's so pretty, has such a beautiful smile, has the same interests as me, and most of all, loves me. But,
    she doesn't exist. The Abby I had fallen in love with was real, but the Abby that had fallen in love with
    me was not. I question if I'll ever find another girl as similar to me and as accepting of me. I doubt I
    will. I just can't imagine anyone else quite like her ever existing again. Nobody will ever be perfect for
    me again, because they won't be her.
</p>
<p>
    Anyways, it's just about 6AM, so I should probably be getting to sleep. I hope you enjoyed reading about
    my dumb gay ass. Bye!
