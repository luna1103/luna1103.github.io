    I've known for a while that things between me and Abby will just never work out, but, God, every 
    time I see a sign of it, and get reminded of it, it just rips me to shreds. It just makes me think
    of the Abby I loved, what could've been. I can't believe it's been almost two months since we broke
    up...
</p>

    She really was something special. We shared so many interests, she was always so nice to me, and it
    really felt like she was the one for me. But it was all for nothing. Now, I don't know if I'd even
    be able to be her friend again. It's only been a few months since we broke up, but God, I can't help
    but think of how much I really loved her, and the circumstances of our relationship.

    I guess another thing is the fact that I am a trans woman and she was a cis woman. It was seriously
    my intent to marry her and have children with her. She told me she wanted that too. I think she was
    genuine about wanting to have children with me, because she had told me that she fantasized about it
    before our relationship.

    This feels a bit icky to say, but I honest to God wish she wasn't polyamorous. Maybe then, things
    would have worked out. There would still be the age gap complication, but I feel like we could've
    worked that out had she not been poly. It really feels like she genuinely wanted a relationship
    with me, but that it didn't work out because I'm not fucking poly. I can't ever imagine being
    in a poly relationship. Honestly, this whole situation has kind of fucked me up, and now I just
    hate thinking about the concept of polyamory at all.

    Maybe I'm just bitching and moaning and I'll eventually get over it. But as it is, this has lasted
    for months, and I don't see any end to the sadness over this loss and my yearning for her. I fucking
    hate everything. I just wish she fucking loved me.
